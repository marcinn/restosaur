Development status
==================

Restosaur is currently in alpha stage, but it is pretty stable.
API may be changed a little in newer versions, especially from v0.7.

Restosaur v0.6 is used in some production environments and works without
any problems, although it is lacking some functionality.

The unit tests does not cover 100% of the code, currently.

As always -- use it at your own risk.
